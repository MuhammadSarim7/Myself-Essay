My name is Muhammad Sarim and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences. I am in fifth semester, and my journey through this degree has been both challeneging and rewarding, offering me opportunities to grow as a student and a future professional in the field of Software Engineering.
I was born in Jordan and raised in a close-knit family that values education, hardwork, and integrity. My parents have always been my strongest source of support, encouraging me to follow my interests and aim for success in all I do.
From an early age, I have been fascinated by technology to transform the world around us. This passsion led me to choose software engineering as my field of study. The desicion to attend Fast NUCES was driven by the university's strong reputation in producing skilled professionals and its challeneging academic enviroment that pushes students to achieve excellence.
During my time at Fast Nuces, I have gained a solid grip in various aspects of software engineering, including programming, data structures and software design.The coursework has been quite difficult, but it has equipped me with the necessary skills to tackle complex problems and create effictive software solutions. I have worked extensively with languages such as C++, Haskell, NuSMV, and additionally I have gained experience with web technologies like HTML and CSS, which have allowed me to create basic user interfaces and understand the structure of web applications. I have also had the oppurtunity to work on practical projects that have helped me apply that I have learned in real-world scenarios.
Aside from academics, I am also involved in extracurricular activities. I have also taken part in organizing and managing events on campus, and I was in the event management team of registrations and invitations. I have also taken part in several technical workshops where I had the oppurtunity to apply my skills in a collaborative environment. These experiences have build and grown my confidence and enhance my ability to work underpressure while delivering successful outcomes.
