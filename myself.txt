My name is Muhammad Sarim and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences. I am in the fifth semester, and my journey through this degree has been both challenging and rewarding, offering me opportunities to grow as a student and a future professional in Software Engineering.
I was born in Jordan and raised in a close-knit family that values education, hard work, and integrity. My parents have always been my strongest source of support, encouraging me to follow my interests and aim for success in all I do.
From an early age, I have been fascinated by technology to transform the world around us. This passion led me to choose software engineering as my field of study. The decision to attend Fast NUCES was driven by the university's strong reputation for producing skilled professionals and its challenging academic environment that pushes students to achieve excellence.
At Fast Nuces, I have gained a solid grip on various aspects of software engineering, including programming, data structures, and software design. The coursework has been quite difficult, but it has equipped me with the necessary skills to tackle complex problems and create effective software solutions. I have worked extensively with languages such as C++, Haskell, and NuSMV, and additionally, I have gained experience with web technologies like HTML and CSS, which have allowed me to create basic user interfaces and understand the structure of web applications. I have also had the opportunity to work on practical projects that have helped me apply what I have learned in real-world scenarios.
Aside from academics, I am also involved in extracurricular activities. I have also taken part in organizing and managing events on campus, and I was in the event management team of registrations and invitations. I have also taken part in several technical workshops where I had the opportunity to apply my skills in a collaborative environment. These experiences have built and grown my confidence and enhanced my ability to work under pressure while delivering successful outcomes.
Although I don't usually have much free time, whenever I do get some, I try to do something productive and fulfilling. I enjoy going to the gym and running, which helps me to stay fit and maintain a disciplined routine. In my leisure time, I also enjoy exploring different places and experiencing their unique cultures through traveling.
I am deeply interested in the concept of peace and how it can be promoted at both personal and societal levels. I enjoy continuously learning new skills, whether it's through online courses, workshops, or self-study, to stay updated in my field and enhance my overall productivity. I  have a keen interest in reading books and articles on productivity, self-improvement, and efficiency and applying these insights to my daily routines.
In the future, I hope to continue my studies by enrolling in a Master's Program at a recognized university overseas. My ambition is to learn more about software engineering at an advanced level and explore new research opportunities. My goal is to use the knowledge and abilities I have received from my Bachelor's and Master's to work on important projects that develop technology and solve societal issues in the future.
At present, my primary goal is to deepen my knowledge and expertise in artificial intelligence (AI). I am actively pursuing this objective through my coursework and projects at PIAIC, where I am focusing on key areas like Generative AI and Cloud Native Development.
In conclusion, my journey as a student of software engineering has been marked by a deep passion for technology, a commitment to personal growth, and a clear vision for the future.
